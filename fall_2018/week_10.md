## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week was Thanksgiving break so I didn't get any work done (same with everyone really). 

I learned that my commits have been too large. I usually always commit all of my tested changes to a completely refactored file at once, for instance. I learned that I should be commiting smaller changes more frequently and will be doing so from now on.

## This Week's Plan

Get a new issue to tackle from Charlie or Alex.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing.

## Notes

No notes.
