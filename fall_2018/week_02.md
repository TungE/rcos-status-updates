## Last Week's Accomplishments

Learned about the scope of the observatory project with the group from Alex S.
Joined the RCOS Observatory organization on GitHub.
Was assigned and read through the first issue assigned to me on observatory-server.

## This Week's Plan

Plan to learn more about VueJS and have a bonus working session to kick off our work (this was the plan for last week but we have not scheduled group sessions for these yet). 
Make attempt(s) at solving the first assigned GitHub issue.
This, in part, means how to test and "upload" my progress.

## Anything Blocking?

Somewhat under the weather.
Large, foreign, poorly commented code base to become familiar with.
First issue was assigned Sunday night.

## Notes

This first issue should be, in some ways, the hardest one.
