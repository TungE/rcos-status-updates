## Last Week's Accomplishments

Although I wrote in last week's status update that the one mistake was fixed and the pull request was granted, it was in fact, not. I fixed the small mistake (a missing await keyword that was not caught by the tests), went through the code base and manually resolved the merge conflicts with Alex, tested the code with our "npm test" command, and pushed the modifications for the existing pull request.

I started refactoring the user.controller.js file (got a few of the smaller functions done).

## This Week's Plan

Alex assigned me to similarly refactor (replace callbacks and .then() with async/await) the user controller (user.controller.js). As this is another big file (900+ lines), this process may take 1-2 work sessions.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing truly blocking, although I was a few minutes late to the small group session because my professor of the previous class inadvertently kept me too long.

## Notes

No notes.
