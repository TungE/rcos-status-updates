## Last Week's Accomplishments

I tested/fixed the refactored room and smallgroup controller files (all tests passed), and the correpsonding pull request was also granted.

## This Week's Plan

Plan to learn about VueJS in Alex's Wednesday bonus session. 
Rewrite classYear.getCurrent() and all of it's 20+ locations across the code base.

## Anything Blocking?

I have been to the nurse's office a few times for a new, minor heart condition which has been troubling me (right bundle branch block), and my first appointment with the cardiologist will likely go for long enough that I won't be able to attend the long-awaited VueJS bonus session.
