## Last Week's Accomplishments

I changed the attendance controller so that mentors no longer need to verify their own attendance, then was assigned to the already existing issue addressed to this on GitHub. This change was contained in the attend function and consisted of the addition of a simple check. Then I created and self-assigned and issue for updating deprecated express functions (res.json(status, obj) and res.status(status)) identified by the tests (invoked by "npm test"). Small changes for this purpose were spread across four files. I made a PR for these changes.

I also contributed to the slides for our presentation on Friday.
