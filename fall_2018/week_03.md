## Last Week's Accomplishments

Learned about API routes and controllers from Alex and Charlie.
Learned about "promises" in code.
Got and used Postman and VSCode to do some work/testing with the project.
Learned how to and made my first pull request, which was approved.
Roughly finished my first two issues, relating to API routes and controller for URP Form.

## This Week's Plan

Plan to learn more about VueJS in a bonus session (this was the plan for last week but we have not scheduled group sessions for these yet). 
Find another issue and start working on it.

## Anything Blocking?

Very under the weather. Not sure if I will be able to make much progress this week.

## Notes

No notes.
