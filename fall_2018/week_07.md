## Last Week's Accomplishments

I rewrote the classYear.getCurrent and classYear.getGetCurrentCodes functions in the corresponding model file to return a then-able object instead of taking a callback. I refactored all 20+ uses of these functions in various controller files across the code base to use async/await. I tested these changes (all tests passed), and the correpsonding pull request was also granted (one small mistake Alex caught).

## This Week's Plan

Find a new issue to work on this week, preferably to do with async/await.

## Anything Blocking?

Alas, the long-awaited VueJS session I had to miss because of my cardiologist appointment. Other than that, nothing truly blocking.

## Notes

No notes.
