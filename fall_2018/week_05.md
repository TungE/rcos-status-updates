## Last Week's Accomplishments

A more accomplished week to make up for being sick / no small group meeting (because of holiday) in the last two week.

I made another routes and controller file for a new model.
I learned the use/benefits of javascript's await VS callbacks and promises. 
I refactored the room and smallgroup controller files (the latter of which is quite big) using this, but have not tested these refactorings.

## This Week's Plan

Plan to learn more about VueJS in a bonus session (this was the plan for last week but we have not scheduled group sessions for these yet). 
Test the above refactored code and find more code to refactor.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing unexpected and big.

## Notes

No notes.
