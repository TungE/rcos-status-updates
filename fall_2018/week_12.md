## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, we (the Observatory team) rehearsed our presentation in small group and presented in large group. Also, I worked on / finished one last commit/issue/PR about removing the "favorite project" functionality from the backend, as we deemed it an undesired feature.

## This Week's Plan

None.

## Anything Blocking?

None.

## Notes

This is my last status update.
