## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I consulted with Varun about how mentors want to utilize the calendar feature in the future. I found the plan of using google calendar to import a csv file to automatically create the calendar for proof of concept. In the future, mentors can directly add to a google calendar and the changes will be reflected in the live site. This way, a csv or spreadsheet can also be automatically generated from the calendar, if desired. I started reformatting the current RCOS calendar spreadsheet to google's import specifications.

## This Week's Plan

I need to continue with this week's work and fully integrate the events into the calendar. I also need to create and rehearse slides for next week's presentation.

## Anything Blocking?

None.

## Notes

None.
