## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I created a functional (although completely blank) tab on the navbar to be used for the new calendar feature. This involved creating/changing several (~10) files, from the master routes file to controller files (it was a big commit). I also deleted the leave small group button entirely, per mentor Varun's request. 

## This Week's Plan

This week's plan (and the plan for more or less the rest of the semester) is to research, develop, and test the new calendar feature. I will start by looking at different designs of calendars (e.g. list of dates vs. weekly grid) and asking mentors how they would like to input dates of events. Also, many artifacts remain from copying some boilerplate from the smallgroup folder, so I need to work on removing some of that too.

## Anything Blocking?

None.

## Notes

Mentor Varun was a big help to this last week. He checked in with me and gave me some guidance/advice about what to work on.
