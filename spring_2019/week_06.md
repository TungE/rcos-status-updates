## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I migrated the style of the tags on the project page from the html to the less file. I also created a folder and necessary files for the new calendar tab.

## This Week's Plan

The new calendar tab will be a big undertaking for me. I will need to start by adding to the routes file and navbar.

## Anything Blocking?

Not really a direct blocker, but two of my assignment deadlines got pushed up, which I did not expect. I may not be able to be as productive this and next week.

## Notes

None.
