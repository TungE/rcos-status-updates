## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I added the following things to the new calendar tab. I added a functional google calendar plugin using the iframe html tag, added some styling to work towards the final design concept, added the red RCOS website banner to the tab (which many other tabs have), and I fixed a bug with the new calendar tab that it previously wasn't lighting up red when active.

## This Week's Plan

Before moving on with the calendar, I need to ask mentors how they would like to input dates of events. Also, many artifacts remain from copying some boilerplate from the smallgroup folder, so I need to work on removing some of that too.

## Anything Blocking?

None.

## Notes

None.
