## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I made a decent handful of front-end UI improvements. I addressed the GitHub issue of adding hyperlinks for the user profiles and project profiles on the smallgroup page, so that mentors amd fellow smallgroup members will have an easier time reaching the page they want to get to. I addressed the GitHub issue user bio text not wrapping properly on the user profile page. I partially addressed GitHub issue of the leave small group button being misleading (it appeared to mean "leave fullscreen" but it means "leave smallgroup") and the text has been updated accordingly. Finally, I added a display for tags for each project on the project list page, per mentor Varun's suggestion (although the issue is not technically on GitHub yet). 

(Although I added a set of radio buttons last week for the user to select a pronoun in the user settings, integrating this into the submission form, storing and retrieving the database information, and updating the mongoose schema is too difficult a task for me to do alone. It will have to stay non-functional until someone with more expertise comes along.)

## This Week's Plan

The displayed tags for projects on the project list page are not following the LESS files I modified, so for now their CSS style is hard-coded; this needs to be moved into the LESS files. Past that, Varun recommended that I add a calendar page for RCOS (displaying guest talks, large group meetings, and so on), which will be my first big new feature for Observtory. 

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing new.

## Notes

None.
