## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I have been investigating the location and structure of the seed data used to instantiate a local server of Observatory3. I needed to do this to learn how to manipulate the data, so that I can properly test new front-end features, such as the one I implemented last week. I found the local seed data directory, but the authentication measures seem to be preventing me from affecting user data.

## This Week's Plan

I plan to continue to look for a way to add new regular/bonus meeting data to my local instance of Observatory3, whether that be through manipulating the seed data directly or giving myself admin capabilities.

## Anything Blocking?

Between the snow day last Tuesday, the large group today (Friday), and the day off next Tuesday, I have not been able to continue to work with Mike.

## Notes

None.
