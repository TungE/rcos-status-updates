## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, Mike and I have been working together to start to understand the basic architecture of the front-end of Observatory, as well as how the html files, javascript controller files, and vuejs files fit together. 

So far, we have created a check box on the attendance page, and linked the value of the check box to filter out or not filter out bonus sessions. This way, the attendance page will look much cleaner, because most people don't go to many of the bonus sessions, and may only want to see the required meetings.

## This Week's Plan

I plan to clean up and further test the code from this week with a local instance of the website.

## Anything Blocking?

Mike tried to contact Alex S., the lead from last semester, but I don't think we received a response. His insight on the direction and architecture of the project would be helpful to say the least.

## Notes

None.
