## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I cleaned up the code for the front-end checkbox (on the attendance page which filters out bonus sessions when clicked), added a label for it, and pushed the change to my fork. 

It does not appear that modifying the seed data I found has any effect, which is beyond me. Other than creating a new account through the local server instancce, no other data (such as user bio data) seems to be able to be changed (whether through the website or modifying the seed data files directly). So that endeavor seems to have run into a dead end.

I'm currently starting to look into an issue from Github, which is to allow users to select a pronoun for themselves on Observatory. I found the user settings html file and controller, and will work with those two files for the time being.

## This Week's Plan

Add a framework for users to select a pronoun for themselves on Observatory.

## Anything Blocking?

With the off day last Tuesday, Mike unable to attend the small groups, and a lack of direction for the project, progress has been a very ad-lib process.

## Notes

None.
