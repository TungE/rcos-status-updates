## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I started working on allowing users to select a pronoun for themselves on Observatory. In the user settings html file, I added a set of radio buttons corresponding to the person's selected pronoun.

## This Week's Plan

This week is spring break, so I may not be working on Observatory. However, for the week after that, I plan to incorporate the form results from the radio buttons into the user profile data, and I also need to make sure I give the users the right selection of pronouns. I might also need to update a schema. I'm not at all familiar with the specifics, so this may take a bit of time just to research. 

## Anything Blocking?

Not really sure if I am just alone and wandering on this project. I'm trying to take the initiative to find and work on issues, but I have very little experience in web development and don't have someone to guide me, so progress has been slow. 

## Notes

None.
