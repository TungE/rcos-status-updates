## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I read and learned about the programming language Rust, which will be used to build the new Observatory. I learned about its design for memory safety, low-level control, and unique concept of ownership/borrowing. It also has some other unique aspects, such as Some/None and Err/Ok as function return types, meaning a whole host of unwrapping methods are commonly used. Lastly, I cloned the git repo for the new observatory and installed Rust.
