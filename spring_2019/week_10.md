## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I completed the mock csv file from the current RCOS calendar spreadsheet and imported it into the google calendar for the presentation demo as proof of concept. I spent the rest of my time this week creating and rehearsing the presentation, and going through a dry run with my small group. Additionally, I met with Professor Turner and Steven vanZyl about transitioning to the new Observatory.

## This Week's Plan

I will contact Steven to get an update on the development status of the new Observatory and continue from there.

## Anything Blocking?

None.

## Notes

None.
